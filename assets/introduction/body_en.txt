The Association’s mission is to preserve and develop the spiritual values and practices of Daoism in today’s society.

Upholding the principle of “Inheriting the Dharma of Jingyang, and letting the Dao soar across the Western land,” the Association organizes scripture recitations, lectures, cultural programs, and charitable activities. It seeks to integrate traditional Taoist classics, ritual lineages, talismanic practices, and methods of self-cultivation with modern life. At the same time, it actively engages with Taoist communities and academic institutions worldwide, building intercultural bridges and demonstrating the unique value of Daoism in the diverse global context.

The name Yangzhu symbolizes the rising sun and the soaring flight of vitality, representing the brightness and ever-renewing spirit of Daoism. The Yangzhu Taoist Association of America aspires to join hands with all sectors of society to promote Taoist heritage and to share Taoist wisdom for the well-being of humanity and the peace of the world.
